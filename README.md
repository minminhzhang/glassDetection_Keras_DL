# glassDetection_Keras_DL
A deep learning model for glass detection of real world images
1. Preparing dataset for model: CelebA
2. Preprocessing image data for training, validation and test
3. Constructing model with convolution layers and fully connected layers
4. Training and testing model with 60k images
5. Predicing image samples and comparing the initial image with their feature maps
